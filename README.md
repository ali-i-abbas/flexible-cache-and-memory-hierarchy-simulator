# Implementing a flexible cache and memory hierarchy simulator

University of Central Florida, Department of Computer Science, CDA 5106: Fall 2020
Machine Problem 1: Cache Design, Memory Hierarchy Design

In this machine problem, you will implement a flexible cache and memory hierarchy simulator and
use it to compare the performance, area, and energy of different memory hierarchy configurations,
using a subset of the SPEC 2000 benchmark suite.

The problem description can be found in "MP1_Instructions.pdf" and the results of the simulation is in "report.pdf"

CacheSimulatorExperiments folder contains code that automates running multiple runs and report the results in csv file
